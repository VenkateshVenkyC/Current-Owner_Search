A current owner search is a type of title search that focuses on identifying the current owner of a property, along with any liens, mortgages, judgments, or other encumbrances affecting the title. This search typically covers the period from the time the current owner acquired the property to the present. It is widely used in real estate transactions for due diligence purposes.
