What is a **Title Search?**

A title search involves examining public records to confirm a property’s legal ownership and identify any legal claims, encumbrances, or other restrictions. It ensures the title is clear (free from disputes) and transferable.

### Components of a Title Search:

**1. Current Owner Search:** Verifies the current owner and identifies issues from their ownership period.


**2. Chain of Title Search:** Examines the entire history of property ownership.


***3. Lien Search:** Identifies financial claims such as mortgages, tax liens, or judgments.


**4. Easements and Restrictions:** Reviews any rights others have to use the property or legal restrictions.

**What Does a Current Owner Search Include?**

Determines if the property has any unpaid liens or judgments against it.

**Includes financial obligations like:**

Mortgage liens (primary and secondary).

### Steps in the Current Owner Search Process

**Step 1:** Collect Property Information

Start with the property address or parcel identification number (PIN). Verify this data using the local County Assessor’s or Recorder’s Office.

**Step 2:** Examine the Last Recorded Deed

Retrieve the last deed of conveyance to verify:

Owner’s name.

Date of ownership transfer.

Property description.


**Step 3:** Review Lien and Judgment Records

**Search for:**

Mortgage documents recorded against the property.

Tax liens, judgment liens, or mechanics liens.

HOA dues or assessments (if applicable).


**Step 4:** Analyze Property Taxes

Check with the County Treasurer’s Office to confirm:

The current year’s taxes are paid.

No delinquent taxes exist.


**Step 5:** Identify Encumbrances and Restrictions

Look for:

Recorded easements (e.g., utility access).

Zoning restrictions or covenants.

Deed restrictions limiting property use.


**Step 6:** Confirm Public Records Accuracy

Cross-reference the property records between the County Recorder, Property Appraiser, and Tax Collector offices.

While Doing a **Title** Search - Important Points

**1. Accuracy is Key:** Verify the current owner’s name matches exactly across all documents. Even minor discrepancies can delay transactions.


**2. Timeframe Matters:** A current owner search focuses solely on the current owner's tenure, typically from the date they acquired the property to the present. This reduces the search timeframe compared to a full chain of title search.


**3. Verify Legal Description:** Ensure the property’s legal description is consistent across all documents. Errors here can lead to disputes.


**4. Mortgage Release:** Confirm that all prior mortgages recorded by the current owner have been satisfied or released.


### 5. Special Assessments: Watch for assessments unique to the state:

Florida: CDD fees and potential liens tied to homestead exemptions.

Arizona: HOA dues in gated or planned communities.

Colorado: Encumbrances tied to water rights in rural properties.


**6. Pending Actions:** Identify active lawsuits or probate cases affecting the current owner’s title rights.


**7. Tax Proration:** Calculate unpaid taxes (if any) that may need to be settled at closing.
